Service meshes allow software platforms to do a lot of your applications’ heavy lifting. The infrastructure 
standardization they offer allows security, traffic management, and observability challenges to be taken out
of developers’ hands and managed centrally.

These benefits do not come for free, however, and service meshes such as Istio are famous for their management
complexities. They are also relatively new and changing quickly. However, the promise of being able to “decouple
at layer five,” for example, is a powerful one. The potential of service meshes makes them likely to persist as
more and more organizations move to microservices architectures.
